>Phyrexians reproduce using flesh-vats and birthing pods, or they are created by infecting other beings with glistening oil. The oil is a mutagen that first twists the minds of the infected, before eventually replacing all vital liquids in the host body. This prepares the host for compleation, a surgical process overseen by other Phyrexians that integrates the body's organic matter with artificial machinery. If these procedures prove fatal, necromancy reanimates the host. Once the host's body is fully integrated with machinery, they are considered truly Phyrexianized.
## Compleated Traits
You might have once been a member of another race, but you now possess only the following racial traits.
* ***Ancestral Legacy.** You keep the following elements of your previous race: your Creature Type, your Size, and your Speed.
* ***Creature Type.** In addition to your creature type, you are also considered a phyrexian for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a phyrexian.
* ***Life Span.** You cease aging and cannot be aged magically.
* **Integrated Artifice.** You gain one weapon or tool of your choice that attaches to your body, becoming inseparable from you. As a bonus action, you can retract the item into your body or extend it from there. While it is extended, you can use the item as if you were holding it, and you are proficient with it.
* **Phyrexian Nature.** You have immunity to disease, and you have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.
* **Specialized Design.** You gain an additional benefit based on one of the following options (choose when you gain this race): Secondary Arms. You have two secondary arms below your primary pair of arms. The secondary arms function like your primary arms.
	* **Heated Body.** A creature that hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you takes fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus. A creature grappling or grappled by you also takes that damage at the start of each of your turns.
	* **Unnatural Armor.** While you aren't wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 12 + your Constitution modifier.

## Glistening Oil
*Hazard* 
Glistening oil is an infectious black ichor. Some Phyrexian creatures weaponize this oil by coating their weapons with it. On New Phyrexia, the oil can be found leaking from structures, collecting in pools and fountains, or dripping from the spheres above. A pool of glistening oil typically covers a 10-foot square. 
A creature can avoid being struck by dripping glistening oil with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. 
**A creature that comes into contact with glistening oil must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become afflicted with phyresis until cured.**
Phyresis can't be cured by any means short of a wish spell.
>At the end of each long rest, a creature afflicted with phyresis must repeat the Constitution saving throw. 

A creature wearing hexgold armor has advantage on this saving throw. 
A creature under the effects of a potion of **halo** or a **cosmos elixir** automatically succeeds on this saving throw. If a creature fails its saves ten times (the failures don't need to be consecutive), the affliction ends, and creature gains the following traits: 
* **All Will Be One**. You gain a new character bond that supersedes all others: "I serve Phyrexia." You are free to interpret this bond in accordance with your alignment; you may seek to hide this new bond from others to further Phyrexia's goals in secret, or you may attempt to infect others by force.
* **Glistening Strike**. Your unarmed strikes are coated with glistening oil.
* **Language**. You can speak, read, and write Phyrexian.
